## Final Project
For our final project, we implement the Chess AI by using many types of different agents, including Random(with little intelligence), Minimax(alpha-beta pruing), Expectimax, MCTS and simple Neural Network. First, we find the appropriate evaluation function so that different chesses can act more efficiently. For NN model, we implement an auto-training process  
by using stored and preprocessed data which is produced by other agents' playing to enhance its performance.
